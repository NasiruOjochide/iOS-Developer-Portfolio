# iOS-Developer-Portfolio


Hi, My name is Nasiru Danjuma, an iOS developer from Nigeria. This repository holds a brief insight into the projects I've worked on as well as links to said projects.

ðŸ”— [# SnowSeeker](https://github.com/NasiruOjochide/SnowSneeker)

SnowSeeker is an App designed to provide information about ski resorts around the world. It holds information about each resort such as its size, price, elevation and snow. I also provide the facilities available at each resort.
The User can search through a list of resorts to get a particular one, they can sort the list in order of name or country. Upon selecting a resort, they get to see descriptive information about the resort and can also set it as a favourite. I also use SizeClass and dynamicTypeSize to make the app responsive and perfectly scaled on various devices including an iPad. Click on link above to check out code.
